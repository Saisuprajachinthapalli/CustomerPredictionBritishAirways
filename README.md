# CustomerPredictionBritishAirways
I recently participated in the British Airways job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Data Science team at British Airways.
I worked on a project where I analysed customer insights and built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour. I practised my data analytics skills using a Jupyter Notebook and built my PowerPoint and communication skills by presenting insights in a real-world context.
Doing this programme confirmed that I really enjoy working with data to provide business insights, and I'm excited to apply these skills to a Data Science team at a company like British Airways
